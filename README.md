This repo serves as exploration of primarily OpenCV in addition to some OCR tasks.

The image and video preprocessing capabilities contained in OpenCV are intriguing as I continue to delve into Computer Vision oriented exploration projects. 

The goal is to intertwine base knowledge of OpenCV and CNNs to build some fun NN classification models and also accomplish image recognition tasks (images & videos).
