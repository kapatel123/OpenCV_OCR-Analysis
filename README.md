This repo serves as exploration of primarily OpenCV in addition to some OCR tasks.

The image and video preprocessing capabilities contained in OpenCV are intriguing as I continue to delve into Computer Vision oriented exploration projects. 

The goal is to intertwine base knowledge of OpenCV and CNNs to build some fun NN classification models and also accomplish image recognition tasks (images & videos).


Future Planned Updates:
- ** Stage 1 **
    - Process image file types (jpeg and png) from the beginning of the process (currently only pdf)
    - Fixes for contour list (returns none if none found, errors out, add a pass)
    - More robust methodology for ensuring rotation of tilted images (2-3 ideas on this. One being left/right and up/down white space check)
    - Add tilted images to sample folder 
    - Explore different preprocess steps for messier images (need to collect more samples for this)
    - Postprocess cleanup for extracted text
- ** Stage 2 - Classification Modeling **
- ** Stage 3 - OCR Camera App **
